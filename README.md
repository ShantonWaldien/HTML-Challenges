# Challenges
Todays lecture was pretty interesting , I definitely enjoyed it.
We learnt a bit of basic HTML coding and sort of designed our own little mini website about who we are and what we like.
It was pretty interesting and easy to understand.
I look forward to what we learn in the near future.
